    "section": "",
    "text": "From 2010 to 2018, a team from the Omaha Public Schools district qualified for the Class A State Football Championship seven times. They won four titles in that span. Omaha North won in 2013, 2014, and 2017. Their 2014 team is regarded as one of the most-dominant football teams in Class A history. Omaha Burke won in 2018 with two-time AP All-American and Notre Dame standout Xavier Watts on the team. On the surface, OPS was enjoying a lot of success in football.\nJust don’t dig any deeper than Omaha North and Omaha Burke.\n\nWhatever you do, do NOT look at Omaha Northwest, South, Benson, or Bryan. \nThere are bad teams, there are really bad teams, there are awful teams, and then there are Omaha Northwest, Omaha South, Omaha Benson, and Omaha Bryan. Throw in semi-recently opened Omaha Buena Vista, and you have five football programs that are conveniently located at the bottom of this bar chart.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\nOPS_Results &lt;- read_csv(\"OPS_Results.csv\")\nTotal_Results &lt;- read_csv(\"Total_Results.csv\")\n\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(\n    data=Total_Results, \n    aes(x=reorder(TEAM,Win_Pct),\n        weight=Win_Pct), fill=\"lightgrey\") +\n  \n  geom_bar(\n    data=OPS_Results, \n    aes(x=reorder(TEAM,Win_Pct),\n        weight=Win_Pct), fill=\"red\") +\n  \n  coord_flip() +\n  \n  labs(\n    title=\"Class A Win Percentage\", \n    x=\"\",\n    y=\"Win %\",\n    subtitle=\"The 5 teams with the lowest winning percentage since 2001-02 are from OPS.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Nebraska School Activities Association | By John Russell\"\n    ) + \n  \n  theme_minimal()+\n    theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf the 34 teams who have played at least one season of Class A football since the 2001-02 season, the five teams with the lowest winning percentage all reside in the OPS school district. Almost all of these wins were over each other or similarly-bad teams. None of the bottom five teams have beaten a team that finished above .500 since September 30th, 2005, or 7,137 days. This means that Omaha South has sent a player to the NFL (Noah Fant) more recently than they have beaten a winning football program. Yikes.\n\nThis tells a story, but it doesn’t tell the full story. Sure, these four schools (plus Buena Vista) have lost a lot more than they have won. But, it’s not just that they lose, but how they lose. Blowouts, shutouts, forfeits, you name it.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  \ngeom_point(\n    data=Total_Results, \n    aes(x=TEAM, y=Avg_PD), color=\"darkgrey\")+\n  \n  geom_point(\n    data=OPS_Results, \n    aes(x=TEAM, y=Avg_PD), color=\"red\")+\n  \n  geom_text(aes(x=\"Omaha Bryan\", y=-20, label=\"Bryan              \"), color=\"red\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=\"Omaha Benson\", y=-25, label=\"Benson                \"), color=\"red\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=\"Omaha Northwest\", y=-27, label=\"Northwest                    \"), color=\"red\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=\"Omaha South\", y=-23, label=\"South              \"), color=\"red\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=\"Omaha Buena Vista\", y=-35, label=\"Buena Vista                        \"), color=\"red\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=\"Omaha Westview\", y=-12, label=\"Westview                    \"), color=\"red\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=\"Omaha Central\", y=2.4, label=\"                Central\"), color=\"red\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=\"Omaha Burke\", y=4.4, label=\"Burke              \"), color=\"red\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=\"Omaha North\", y=16, label=\"North            \"), color=\"red\") +\n  \n  \n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = \"black\") +\n  \n  labs(\n    title=\"Class A Average Point Margin\", \n    x=\"Organized By Team Name In Alphabetical Order\",\n    y=\"Average Point Differential\",\n    subtitle=\"5 teams lose by more than 20 points per game.

Ideally, teams want to be above zero. This would mean that they are scoring more points than their opponents on average. Omaha Burke and Omaha Central accomplish this just barely. Omaha North is comfortably above that zero line.\nOmaha Westview, which opened in 2022, is sitting at about -12, or an average game for them is a 12-point loss. By this metric, they are the 4th-best OPS team.\n\nOmaha Bryan, South, Benson, Northwest, and Buena Vista all sit below -21, or a three-touchdown loss on average. Northwest sits at a four-touchdown loss, and Buena Vista is all the way at five. The thing about averages is that, in theory, 50% of the results are worse than whatever the average is, or in this case, teams are losing by more than three, four, or five touchdowns consistently.\nThe teams highlighted in red are the non-OPS teams, because its much quicker to highlight the four non-OPS schools than the 21 OPS schools.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(gt)\n\nPDTop25&lt;- read_csv(\"Top_25_PD.csv\")\n\nPDTop25 |&gt; \n  \n  gt() |&gt; \n  cols_label(\n    Seaon = \"Season\",\n    Winner = \"Winner\",\n    Loser = \"Loser\",\n    Score = \"Score\",\n    PD = \"Margin\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"25 Worst Blowouts in Class A Football\",\n    subtitle = \"OPS Schools have been on the wrong end of 21 of the worst 25 point margins since 2001-02.\"\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** John Russell  |  **Source:** Nebraska School Activities Association\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=12)\n     )\n   ) |&gt;\n  opt_row_striping() |&gt; \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\")|&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"red\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n      ),\n  locations = cells_body(\n    rows = (Loser == \"Bellevue East\" | Loser == \"South Sioux City\" | Loser == \"Lincoln High\")\n  )\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n25 Worst Blowouts in Class A Football\n\n\nOPS Schools have been on the wrong end of 21 of the worst 25 point margins since 2001-02.\n\n\nSeason\nWinner\nLoser\nScore\nMargin\n\n\n\n\n2023-24\nLincoln North Star\nOmaha Benson\n93-0\n93\n\n\n2005-06\nLincoln Southwest\nLincoln High\n84-0\n84\n\n\n2015-16\nBellevue West\nBellevue East\n82-0\n82\n\n\n2023-24\nOmaha Central\nOmaha Northwest\n78-0\n78\n\n\n2024-25\nLincoln Northeast\nOmaha Benson\n77-0\n77\n\n\n2018-19\nBellevue West\nBellevue East\n81-6\n75\n\n\n2023-24\nElkhorn South\nOmaha Northwest\n75-0\n75\n\n\n2021-22\nBellevue West\nOmaha Northwest\n72-0\n72\n\n\n2024-25\nOmaha Burke\nOmaha South\n78-6\n72\n\n\n2019-20\nOmaha Westside\nOmaha Northwest\n77-6\n71\n\n\n2017-18\nMillard West\nOmaha Bryan\n70-0\n70\n\n\n2018-19\nGrand Island\nOmaha Bryan\n77-7\n70\n\n\n2022-23\nElkhorn South\nOmaha Northwest\n84-14\n70\n\n\n2008-09\nMillard South\nOmaha South\n70-0\n70\n\n\n2024-25\nElkhorn South\nOmaha South\n70-0\n70\n\n\n2022-23\nBennington\nOmaha Westview\n70-0\n70\n\n\n2022-23\nMillard North\nSouth Sioux City\n70-0\n70\n\n\n2013-14\nMillard West\nOmaha Bryan\n69-0\n69\n\n\n2019-20\nGrand Island\nOmaha Bryan\n69-0\n69\n\n\n2024-25\nElkhorn South\nOmaha Burke\n69-0\n69\n\n\n2009-10\nOmaha Burke\nOmaha Northwest\n69-0\n69\n\n\n2019-20\nElkhorn South\nOmaha Northwest\n76-7\n69\n\n\n2023-24\nOmaha North\nOmaha Northwest\n69-0\n69\n\n\n2024-25\nGrand Island\nOmaha Northwest\n69-0\n69\n\n\n2009-10\nMillard South\nOmaha Benson\n75-7\n68\n\n\n\nBy: John Russell | Source: Nebraska School Activities Association\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, 93-0. And really, it was much worse. By halftime, North Star had set a new Class A record for points in a game by a single team with 86. The game ended early in the third quarter. \n\nOmaha Burke’s 2024-25 team appears here twice, once as a 69-0 loser to Elkhorn South, then as a 78-6 winner over Omaha South three weeks later. This shows just how massive the gap is between good, bad and uncompetitive.\nA common debate heard in recent years was the effect that OPS’s handling of COVID-19 would impact their football programs. Many speculated that it would cause massive setbacks to each program. Many worried that OPS schools would be even worse than they were before. The question that this data aims to answer is “Did it even have an impact on results?” \nThe elevator is beyond the basement floor. It’s buried far, far underground. At this point, it’s not a matter of how close the elevator is to ground-level. It’s a matter of how dangerously close it is to hitting bedrock."

    "text": "High school mascots are more than just symbols. They become synonymous with the school and community that they represent. While many schools adopt common mascots like Eagles, Tigers or Bulldogs, others choose to stand out with unique mascots. Omaha Benson has the Bunnies, Fairbury has the Jeffs, and Columbus has the Discoverers. These mascots all tie into the community in a way that a more-common mascot wouldn’t and gives the community a sense of pride in their uniqueness.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(gt)\n\ndata &lt;- read_csv(\"data.csv\")\n\nmascot_enrollment_count &lt;- data |&gt; \n  \n  group_by(MASCOT) |&gt; \n  \nsummarise(\n  Count=n(),\n  Total=sum(ENROLLMENT),\n  Average=mean(ENROLLMENT)\n  )\n\nmascot_enrollment_count_top20 &lt;- mascot_enrollment_count |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(Total)) |&gt;\ntop_n(20, wt=Total)\n\nBulldogs &lt;- mascot_enrollment_count_top20 |&gt; \n  filter(MASCOT == \"Bulldogs\")\n\nTigers &lt;- mascot_enrollment_count_top20 |&gt; \n  filter(MASCOT == \"Tigers\")\n\nEagles &lt;- mascot_enrollment_count_top20 |&gt; \n  filter(MASCOT == \"Eagles\")\n\nMustangs &lt;- mascot_enrollment_count_top20 |&gt; \n  filter(MASCOT == \"Mustangs\")\n\nWildcats &lt;- mascot_enrollment_count_top20 |&gt; \n  filter(MASCOT == \"Wildcats\")\n\nCardinals &lt;- mascot_enrollment_count_top20 |&gt; \n  filter(MASCOT == \"Cardinals\")\n\nHuskies &lt;- mascot_enrollment_count_top20 |&gt; \n  filter(MASCOT == \"Huskies\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=mascot_enrollment_count_top20, aes(x=reorder(MASCOT, Count), weight=Count), fill=\"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_bar(data=Bulldogs, aes(x=reorder(MASCOT, Count), weight=Count), fill=\"red\")+\n  geom_bar(data=Eagles, aes(x=reorder(MASCOT, Count), weight=Count), fill=\"red\") +\n  geom_bar(data=Tigers, aes(x=reorder(MASCOT, Count), weight=Count), fill=\"red\") +\n  geom_bar(data=Mustangs, aes(x=reorder(MASCOT, Count), weight=Count), fill=\"red\") +\n  geom_bar(data=Wildcats, aes(x=reorder(MASCOT, Count), weight=Count), fill=\"red\") +\n  geom_bar(data=Cardinals, aes(x=reorder(MASCOT, Count), weight=Count), fill=\"red\") +\n  geom_bar(data=Huskies, aes(x=reorder(MASCOT, Count), weight=Count), fill=\"red\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n\nlabs(\n    title=\"Animals dominating the mascot frequency race\", \n    x=\" \",\n    y=\"Mascot Count\",\n    subtitle=\"7 of the 10 most-popular mascots are types of animals.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Nebraska School Activities Association | By John Russell\"\n    ) + \n  \n  theme_minimal()+\n    theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOut of the 302 schools that competed in the 2024-25 NSAA High School football season, there were 98 different mascots across these teams. The most popular mascot choices among these schools were the generic, commonly-used ones that one would see in a movie or TV show. Eagles, Knights, Tigers and so on.\nSchools using animals as mascots is as common of a choice as anything in sports, and Nebraska spotlights that idea. 7 of the 10 most-popular mascot choices are types of animals. 15 football teams in Nebraska call themselves the Eagles, with the largest being Omaha Central (1879 students) and the smallest being Bruning-Davenport (32 students).\nWith 98 different mascots, it becomes necessary to categorize and group them to better understand any trends. The mascots fall into 1 of 10 categories: Bird, Cat, Dog, Human, Insect, Other Animal, Object, Mythical, Weather/Nature, or Miscellaneous.\n\n\nCode\nhumans &lt;- data |&gt; \n  filter(\n    CATEGORY == \"Human\"\n  )\n  \nset.seed(1234)\n  \nggplot() + \n  geom_beeswarm(data=data, aes(x=CATEGORY, y=ENROLLMENT), color=\"darkgrey\")+\n  geom_beeswarm(data=humans, aes(x=CATEGORY, y=ENROLLMENT), color=\"red\")+\n  \n  labs(\n    title=\"Humans winning the category race\", \n    x=\"Mascot Category\",\n    y=\"School Enrollment\",\n    subtitle=\"Human mascots lead the way for categorization.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Nebraska School Activities Association | By John Russell\"\n    ) + \n  \n  theme_minimal()+\n    theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHumans lead the way in this categorization of mascots. They have an abundance of schools with smaller enrollments as well as a healthy number of schools rising up the enrollment count.\nAlthough Nebraska’s most-frequent mascots may be the common, “boring” ones, the state has plenty of options for unique/uncommon mascots as well. Out of the 98 total mascots, 46 schools have mascots that no other school in Nebraska has. These range across all 10 categories and all levels of enrollment. Some have local ties that only that only makes sense for that specific school (Centura Centurions, Pender Pendragons, Lincoln High Links). Some have seemingly no connection to the area unless you take a history lesson. Sutherland calls themselves the Sailors despite being nowhere near the ocean. Gothenburg calls themselves the Swedes despite being nowhere near Sweden. Both of those mascots become clearer with a short history lesson that might not be as well-known if it wasn’t for the conversation sparked by the mascots.\n\n\nCode\nunique_mascots &lt;- data |&gt; \n  filter(\n    MASCOT == \"Links\" | \n    MASCOT == \"Dusters\" |\n    MASCOT == \"Jeffs\" |\n    MASCOT == \"Whippets\" |\n    MASCOT == \"Haymakers\" |\n    MASCOT == \"Chanticleers\" |\n    MASCOT == \"Pendragons\" | \n    MASCOT == \"Sailors\" |\n    MASCOT == \"Bunnies\" |\n    MASCOT == \"Antlers\" |\n    MASCOT == \"Beavers\" |\n    MASCOT == \"Bees\" |\n    MASCOT == \"Blue Knights\" |\n    MASCOT == \"Bluehawks\" |\n    MASCOT == \"Blujays\" |\n    MASCOT == \"Braves\" |\n    MASCOT == \"Cadets\" |\n    MASCOT == \"Cavaliers\" |\n    MASCOT == \"Centurions\" |\n    MASCOT == \"Chargers\" |\n    MASCOT == \"Cheifs\" |\n    MASCOT == \"Clippers\" |\n    MASCOT == \"Defenders\" |\n    MASCOT == \"Discoverers\" |\n    MASCOT == \"Dukes\" |\n    MASCOT == \"Flyers\" |\n    MASCOT == \"Gators\" |\n    MASCOT == \"Hornets\" |\n    MASCOT == \"Islanders\" |\n    MASCOT == \"Jaguars\" |\n    MASCOT == \"Jets\" |\n    MASCOT == \"Junior Jays\" |\n    MASCOT == \"Minuemen\" |\n    MASCOT == \"Navigators\" |\n    MASCOT == \"Orangemen\" |\n    MASCOT == \"Packers\" |\n    MASCOT == \"Plainsmen\" |\n    MASCOT == \"Pride\" |\n    MASCOT == \"Roughriders\" |\n    MASCOT == \"Scouts\" |\n    MASCOT == \"Silverhawks\" |\n    MASCOT == \"Skyhawks\" |\n    MASCOT == \"Stars\" |\n    MASCOT == \"The Swarm\" |\n    MASCOT == \"Thunderbolts\" |\n    MASCOT == \"Timerbwolves\" |\n    MASCOT == \"Wolfpack\" |\n    MASCOT == \"Swedes\")\n  \n  unique_mascots |&gt;
